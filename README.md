## Reach more users for your app with localization!

GPT-Localize-iOS is a tool designed to automatically translate your `.xcstrings` files into any language, using the power and cost-effectiveness of OpenAI's GPT-4 API. This script can even handle translations tailored to various devices, ensuring your iOS app localization is seamless and accurate.

## Features

- **Multiple Language Support:** Translate your strings into tons of languages in record time
- **Multi-Device Translation:** Supports translation of string catalog's device-specific strings
- **OpenAI GPT-4 Integration:** Utilizes the latest GPT-4 model for accurate and contextual translations.
- **Cost Estimation:** Provides an estimate of the translation cost before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

To use GPT-Localize-iOS, you must set up an OpenAI API key. Here's how to do it:

1. Visit [OpenAI's API](https://openai.com/api/) page and sign up for an API key.
2. Once you have your API key, you can set it as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` on your system. Alternatively, the script will prompt you to enter it when needed.

## Usage

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system to run the script. Here is an example command line invocation:

```sh
python3 translate_strings.py --input-file=path/to/your/file.xcstrings --target-language-code=es --source-language-code=en
```

### Command Line Flags

- `--input-file`: The path to your `.xcstrings` file to be translated.
- `--target-language-code`: The target language code (e.g., 'es' for Spanish).
- `--source-language-code`: The source language code of your strings (e.g., 'en' for English).
- `--overwrite-file`: (Optional) If set, the script will overwrite the original file with the translations.
- `--no-cost-prompt`: (Optional) If set to false, the script will prompt you for confirmation before proceeding with the translation, based on the estimated cost.
